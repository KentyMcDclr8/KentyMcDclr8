- 👋 Hi, I’m @KentyMcDclr8, or Faaiz Khan.
- 👀 I’m interested in anything computer programming, science, and engineering related. And games!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about programming languages: how they are made, and database systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything computer programming related. If I had to pick something, it would be game design and development, though.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at faaizkhan4444@gmail.com
